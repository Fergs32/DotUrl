## Description

This program was made to enchance my understanding and knowledge about Cyber Security, this program was made for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, I do not take any responsbility to those who use the program to their advantage.

## Getting Started



### Dependencies

*This application was built on .Net core, which allows Windows, Mac and linux machines to run such program.*

- Runs on Lastest Windows
- Runs on lastest Linux
- Runs on Lastest MacOS

### Installing

* The picture below shows how to download the program, simply to go "Code" and download to ZIP.

* Step 1. Once the folder is open, you'll want to go to ( DotUrl > bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1 > DotUrl.exe )
* Step 2. Once you're in the folder, you will want to click on "DotUrl.exe" this will launch the program and **should** greet you with CUI.

* Potentinal error fixes
* If you get "Unable to grab urls from text file" error, you will want to open the "bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1" folder and add a text file called "urls" this textfile is essential as it's used to store the URL's you would like to scan for vulnerabilites.

* If you get "Unable to grab proxies from text file" error, you will yet again want to open the "bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1" folder and add a text file called "proxies" this textfile is essential as it's used to store the proxies.
